0.1.2 (2009-03-31)
=====
- Bug fix and add virtual server to support multiple network (VLAN, 
  multiple ethernet) and support scripts to do the traffic shape and
  Bittorrent blocking or throttling:

  * Multiple network support using virtual server concepts.
    - Clients with different IP can access to particular virtual server.
    - Each virtual server is independent.
    - Capable to add more virtual server as much as the you want, if the
      memory of the system is available.
  * Traffic shape and Bittorrent blocking or throttling scripts.
    - Traffic shape using TC and synchronize with RahuNAS for each client.
      (Per client shaping)
    - Capable to block the bittorrent, allow someone to access 
      or throttling with the specific download and upload rate. 
      (Require layer7 kernel module)
  * Bug fix.
    - Replace static memory allocation by dynamic memory allocation, 
      the static allocation cause the error when more virtual servers are 
      registered. The dynamic memory allocation reduce the memory requirement 
      for the same size of clients set.
    - Fix the memory allocation for the ipset polling which does not free
      unneccessary data.

0.1.1 (2008-12-09)

- First release of the ready to use Network Access Server which provides:

  * The server that can handle the users login session with 
    [/] idle timeout and session timeout checking.
    [/] setup the bandwidth shaping for downloading and uploading each user.
    [/] integrated with the SQLite for the users session backup.
    [/] more reliability of the network handling with the good concept of
        ipset (http://ipset.netfilter.org). 
    [/] do the normal IP packets traversal with the most capability that the
        Linux kernel could do, no need any tunneling interfaces like other 
        projects do.
    [/] IPv4 with MAC address support. (IPv6 not support now)

  * Do the AAA (Authentication, Authorization and Accouting) with RADIUS.
    Tested with FreeRADIUS as well.
